With today’s Serverless Framework Enterprise release we are adding support for Deployment Profiles, enabling serverless development teams to move fast and scale while enforcing operational and security best practices. 

One of the greatest challenges of a scaling engineering team is educating new team members about organizational security and operational practices. This is especially challenging when those team members are also new to serverless. For example, when they deploy a service you want to make sure they deploy to the right regions and use the AWS Account designated for that stage. Or maybe you want to make sure that they do not deploy to production on Fridays.

Engineering Managers and Operators, with Serverless Framework Enterprise Deployment Profiles, can designate AWS Accounts for each of the stages in their applications, and enforce security and operational policies using Serverless Safeguards.

### AWS Accounts in Deployment Profiles

AWS Credentials Access Role helps you secure your service deployments by enabling Serverless Framework Enterprise to issue temporary AWS Access Keys to deploy your services to AWS.

The AWS Access Keys are generated by Serverless Enterprise on every command and the credentials expire after one hour. Serverless Framework Enterprise leverages AWS Security Token Service and the AssumeRole API to automate creation and usage of temporary credentials, so your developers can stay productive and work securely without doing this manually.

### Safeguard Policies in Deployment Profiles

Serverless Framework Enterprise comes with 15 Safeguards available out of the box, each of which can be added and configured as a Safeguard Policy. By designating it as an “error” you can automatically block any deployment if it does not comply with the Safeguard Policy.

### Safeguard Policies out of the box

Serverless Framework Enterprise comes with 15 safeguard policies available out of the box. We also pre-configure nine of those Safeguards for you. By simply using Serverless Framework Enterprise your services will be checked for compliance with recommended policies automatically. If those policies aren’t enough, you can implement your own too.

### Setting a Deployment Profile for a Stage

In your Application settings you can select different profiles for each of the stages. When you run `serverless deploy` Serverless Framework will obtain the AWS Access Key and Safeguards associated with the deployment profile for that stage. For example, when you deploy to the “dev” stage, Serverless Framework will automatically generate the AWS Access Key for the “dev” AWS Account. Similarly, you can enforce stricter Safeguard Policies on `prod` then on `dev` or `qa` stages.

### Safely deploy

When you run “serverless deploy” a short-lived AWS credentials will be generated by Serverless Framework Enterprise. You won’t need to store any AWS credentials locally, and the right AWS Account will be used for that stage. The Safeguard Policies will be loaded for that stage and evaluated for that service before any resources are provisioned. You can even block a deployment if the service doesn’t comply with a Safeguard Policy.
