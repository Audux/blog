Today we announced a partnership with Tencent, the largest internet company in Asia. If you donâ€™t know Tencent, they provide services for hundreds of millions of people via a wide range of products, like QQ and WeChat. Gamers know them as the company behind Riot Games and League of Legends. Under the covers these popular internet services, and many other similar services from a variety of companies, are powered by the Tencent Cloud, a secure, reliable and high-performance cloud service.

Leveraging both the resources and expertise of Tencent Cloud and the power of the Serverless Framework community, we are together focused on creating a next generation serverless cloud, with the following characteristics:

1. Managed (aka serverless) services that offer outcomes, not infrastructure
2. Everything autoscaling (never pay for idle)
3. Composition and configuration over code

We are just getting started, but today we also released three open-source, Serverless Framework projects that make it easy to deploy some of the most common serverless uses cases onto the Tencent Cloud: Express.js apps; static websites; and REST APIs.

Deploy [Express](https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-express) applications to Tencent Cloud. No need to change your application code or learn new things. We've created a simpler experience for delivering serverless APIs via the new Serverless Express.js Component. In seconds, you can deploy an auto-scaling, pay-per-use Express.js application on Tencent Serverless Cloud Functions.

We have something for front-end developers too. In seconds, you can deploy auto-scaling, pay-per-use, serverless [websites](https://github.com/serverless-components/tencent-website), React and Vue.js applications.

With very little configuration, you can now also easily deploy [REST API endpoints](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/11755) that take advantage of the full range of Tencent API Gateway features (e.g. usage plans and throttling). You can also easily deploy Tencent Serverless Cloud Functions as scheduled jobs, and react to events on Tencent Cloud Object Storage, Tencent Message Broker and Tencent Cloud Kafka.

As you try out each of these open-source projects, tell us how to improve your experience by logging issues and feature requests in the related Github repos.
